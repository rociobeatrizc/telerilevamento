# The "colorist" (R) package was created to provide additional methodologies and options for studying and communicating information on the distribution of wildlife in space and time.
# To do this "colorist" uses Rasterstack images that describe wildlife distributions, processes and links them to HCL palettes in specific ways.
# Resulting visualizations allow viewers to meaningfully compare values of occurrence, abundance, or density over space and time.


# What is the HCL palette? The Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) color space is an alternative to other color spaces such as RGB, HSV, and so on.
# Each color within the HCL color space is defined by a triplet of values. 
# The dimensions are:

   # Hue: defines the color (hue)
   # Chroma: defines the color (saturation or intensity of the color)
   # Luminance: defines the brightness
   # (https://hclwizard.org/images//hclscheme_pic0.png)

# The basic workflow for colorist is:

   # 1.) Metrics: Users calculate metrics to describe their distributions.
   # 2.) Color palette: Users choose a color palette to enable the display of metrics.
   # 3.) Map: Users combine metrics and palette to map distributions into a single map or more.
   # 4.) Legend: Users generate a legend to accompany their map.

# Example 1. Mapping a distribution of species in the annual cycle
# Here, we use eBird status and trend aggregate data for Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) to illustrate a different strategy for creating annual cycle maps, which leverages continuous occurrence data to describe where and when viewers might be able to find a species.

# We can create a palette (HCL).
# We want to choose a palette that helps communicate temporal information about the occurrence of Field Sparrow.
# We will use the palette_timecycle () function because our data represent an ordered and cyclic sequence (all months of the year)

# We have seen how the palette_timecycle function returns us a data frame with three fields: specificy layer_id and color
# The specificity and layer_id fields will be used to assign colors to specific raster cells

# Now we can create a map.
# With the map_multiples () function we will be able to see the map for each layer, therefore for each month of the year
# Inside the parenthesis we will write 1.) The metric / 2.) The palette used / 3.) ncol = x to define the number of columns to display / 4.) Labels = names (filename)
map_multiples(met1, pal, ncol = 3, labels = names (fiespa_occ))

# If we want to extract a month of data for deeper analysis, we can use map_single () and specify which month of data we would like to see using the layer argument.
map_single(met1, pal, layer = 6)

# Single annual cycle map.
# To generate a single annual cycle map that summarizes space-time information on the occurrence of Field Sparrow, we need to "distill" the distributive information into our RasterStack.
# The metrics_distill () function calculates distribution metrics on all levels in each raster cell and returns three metrics for later viewing:

 # - Maximum intensity (that is, the maximum value of occurrence, abundance, or density).
 # - Maximum intensity layer (hence the identity of the layer containing the maximum intensity value)
 # - Specificity of the maximum intensity value for the maximum intensity layer (hence the degree to which the intensity values are unevenly distributed between the layers).

met1_distill <- metrics_distill(fiespa_occ) # we can distill the information
map_single(met1_distill,pal) 
# We then display the information in the single image with the "distilled" images and the palette created previously


# Legend
# Previously we used the palette_timecycle () function and consequently we will use the legend_timecycle () function to display the legend.
# R will return a legend with circles: information about when the time cycle begins (and ends) can also be provided in the "origin_label" argument.
legend_timecycle(pal, origin_label = "jan 1")

# Conclusions
# With all the information described, with the map and with the legend, we are able to understand where and when to find this species.
# The more colored parts will indicate high specificity but high probability of occurrence only at certain times of the year.
# The gray parts, on the other hand, will indicate low specificity but high occurrence throughout the year.
# In this case, low specificity indicates seasonality where 0 indicates presence all year round.

map_multiples(m2,ncol = 3, pal2)

# It often happens that maps are faded.
# The lambda_i parameter in map_multiples () and map_single () allows users to visually adjust the relative weights of high and low intensity values.

# We will see that the lower the lambda_i value, the more intense the color will be

map_multiples(m2,ncol = 3, pal2, lambda_i = -5)


# At this point we can distill the information.
# It is important to remember that specificity values (and the resulting display of specificity values) for Fisher must be interpreted differently than for Field Sparrow.
# Here, specificity values indicate the degree to which the individual used the same locations within the landscape for nine nights. Low specificity suggests consistent use over time.
m2_distill<-metrics_distill(fisher_ud)

# Example 3. Mapping the distributions of multiple individuals during the same time period.

# In the previous examples, we explored the distributions of a single species and a single individual over multiple time periods.
# colorist can also be used to explore the distribution of multiple species or individuals in a single period of time.

# Here, we use GPS tracking data collected from African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Etosha National Park (Namibia) during 2011 to explore how two individuals used the landscape over the course of a year.

# WE SHOULD RE-CALIBRATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEANING OF SPECIFICITY

# We stand in contrast to the Field Sparrow and Fisher examples, where specificity indicated the degree to which intensity values were inconsistent (or consistent) over time.

# THEREFORE LOW SPECIFICITY IS EQUAL TO COMMON USE OF THE LANDSCAPE, HIGH SPECIFICITY INDICATES A DIFFERENTIAL USE OF THE LANDSCAPE
